You will review each submission based on whether each objective/style is achieved or not, and at what level. (For instance, did they put in background-color and if so, did they use hexadecimal or rgb.)

Specifically, you will evaluate submissions by answering the following questions:

Is the header styled with a new background color?
Is the h1 heading styled?
Is the h2 heading styled?
Is the section styled with a new background color?
Are the links styled?
Are the images gone? They shouldnâ€™t be there.

Steps:

Create a file called hw1.css and save it in your css folder.

Style the page using the following rules:

1) Style the header with a background color

2) h1 elements should be centered and have a new font color

3) h2 elements should have a new font color

4) Sections should have a new background color

5) The links should have a new font color and background color (**NOTE: earlier version of this assignment required that the link be centered. So if someone has centered them, do not deduct points.)

6 ) The images should not appear on the page
